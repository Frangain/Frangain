    <section class="museum-intro">
      <h2>History Has Many Rooms.<br />Memory Has Only One.</h2>

      <p>
        For thousands of years, the story of Lebanon was written not only in
        books, but in <strong>coins</strong>. <br /><br />
        Coins that traveled with Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean.
        Coins struck by Roman emperors in Berytus. Coins carried in the pockets
        of our grandparents during the Golden Lira years. Coins that vanished
        when the Lira collapsed. Coins that survived only as
        <strong>memory</strong>. <br /><br />
        <strong>The FRANGAIN Museum</strong> is a digital sanctuary — a place
        where Lebanon’s monetary past is preserved, honored, and retold.
        <br /><br />
        Here, every room is a chapter. Every coin is a witness. Every detail is
        a fragment of who we were, who we became, and what we lost.
        <br /><br />
        And in the final room,
        <strong>the story rises again — in FRANGAIN.</strong>

      <h2>🏺 Room I — The Phoenician Room</h2>
      <p><strong>“Where money first learned to travel.”</strong></p>
      <br />

      <p>Before Lebanon had borders, it had <strong>horizons</strong>.</p>

      <p>
        On these coasts, the Phoenicians mastered the art of trade. Their silver
        coins — stamped with anchors, ships, and sacred symbols — traveled
        farther than any coin before them.
      </p>

      <p>
        They crossed seas. They passed through foreign markets. They carried the
        identity of a civilization that lived through commerce.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>These were not just coins.<br />They were ambassadors.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In this room, you witness the world’s first global traders — and the
        earliest heartbeat of Lebanon’s monetary story.

      <h2>🏛️ Room II — The Roman Room</h2>
      <p><strong>“When Empire met the Mountains.”</strong></p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Under Rome, Lebanon became a world of temples, marketplaces, and
        <strong>imperial minting houses</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beirut, Tyre, and Sidon produced coins with emperors, eagles,
        thunderbolts, and ancient divinities.
      </p>

      <p>
        A coin here wasn’t only payment — it was
        <strong>propaganda, art, and storytelling</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        These coins moved through theatres, busy streets, port markets… through
        hands that shaped both daily life and empire.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Rome imposed its rule — but Lebanon kept its identity.</strong>

      <p><strong>“Copper, silver, and the quiet centuries.”</strong></p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The Ottoman era brought a slower, steadier form of monetary life. Coins
        were small, humble, engraved in elegant Arabic calligraphy.
      </p>

      <p>Majidi silver pieces. Kurush. Para.</p>

      <p>
        These coins lived in the hands of farmers, fishermen, textile workers,
        caravan traders, and villagers from Tripoli to Tyre.
      </p>

      <p><strong>This room whispers rather than shouts.</strong></p>

      <p>
        It reminds us that a currency is not only what is minted — it is the
        rhythm of everyday survival.

      <p><strong>“Between two worlds: the Franc and the Lira.”</strong></p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Under the French Mandate, Lebanon stepped into a new monetary chapter.
        It was the era of <strong>bilingual notes</strong>, mixed influences,
        and a currency searching for its identity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here emerged the Lebanese–Syrian Pound — shared across borders for a
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Banknotes carried Arabic and French. Coins featured cedar trees for the
        very first time.

      <p>
        <strong>
          This room feels like a transition — a moment where Lebanon moved from
          occupation toward a national monetary future.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Two languages.<br />Two worlds.<br />One currency learning to become
        Lebanese.

      <h2>🇱🇧 Room V — The Golden Room</h2>
      <p><strong>“The Lebanese Lira in its finest days.”</strong></p>
      <br />

      <p>
        From the 1940s to the 1970s, the Lebanese Lira reached its most
        dignified era — strong, trusted, stable, and respected across the
        region.
      </p>

      <p>
        Banknotes from this era were pieces of art:
        <br /><span class="gold-bullet">•</span> geometric patterns <br /><span
          class="gold-bullet"
          >•</span
        >

        <br /><span class="gold-bullet">•</span> portraits of Lebanon’s beauty
      </p>

      <p>
        Children received their first Lira. Families managed budgets with
        confidence. Shops wrote prices proudly in Lira.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >This was the Lira at its most beautiful — not only a means of
          payment, but a symbol of national aspiration.</strong

      <h2>🪙 Room VI — The Folklore Room</h2>
      <p><strong>“The coins that became part of who we are.”</strong></p>
      <br />

      <p>
        This room is the heart of the Museum — where memory becomes personal,
        where currency meets childhood.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Real Lebanese coins that truly existed:</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 5 Piastres — خمسة قروش<br />
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 10 Piastres — عشرة قروش<br />
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 25 Piastres — ربع ليرة<br />
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 50 Piastres — نصف ليرة<br />
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 1 Lira — ليرة واحدة
      </p>

      <p>
        Children bought candy with خمسة قروش. Families paid groceries with عشرة
        قروش. Prices often rounded using ربع ليرة and نصف ليرة. The one Lira was
        the proud everyday coin.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Banknotes of daily life (never coins):</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 5 Liras <br /><span
          class="gold-bullet"
          >•</span
        >
        10 Liras <br /><span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 25 Liras <br /><span
          class="gold-bullet"
          >•</span
        >
        50 Liras
      </p>

      <p>
        These were folded in wallets, notebooks, shirt pockets, and envelopes
        from grandparents.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Transitions of later years:</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 100 Liras → became a coin<br />
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 250 Liras → became a coin<br />
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> 500 Liras → became a coin
      </p>

      <p>
        These changes mirrored Lebanon’s evolving economy, inflation,
        resilience, and struggle.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          And the cultural treasure: “فرنك” It was not a coin — it was a memory.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This room is where <strong>FRANGAIN</strong> was born — not from a coin,
        but from a word that refused to disappear.

      <h2>💔 Room VII — The Collapse Room</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>“When a currency breaks, memory becomes the museum.”</strong>
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>Lebanon faced not one collapse — but <strong>two</strong>.</p>
      <br />

      <p><strong>1️⃣ The First Collapse — Early 1980s</strong></p>
      <p>
        Around 1983–1984, inflation began to devour the Lira. Prices rose.
        Salaries shrank. Families struggled. It was Lebanon’s first encounter
        with losing trust in its own currency.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><strong>2️⃣ The Second Collapse — 2019 → Today</strong></p>
      <p>
        Decades later, a deeper collapse arrived:
        <br />• Banks froze people’s savings <br />• The Lira lost more than 90%
        of its value <br />• Prices soared beyond imagination <br />• The
        financial system cracked <br />• A nation entered one of the worst
        crises in modern history
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        This room is heavy. But it is necessary. Because the Museum is not only
        about what we had — it is about what we lost, and what we must remember.

      <h2>✨ Room VIII — The Future Room: FRANGAIN™</h2>
      <p><strong>“Tomorrow’s memory begins here.”</strong></p>

      <p>
        This room is the bridge between the Lebanon that was… and the Lebanon
        that can rise again.
      </p>

      <p>
        FRANGAIN is not a replacement for the Lira. It is not political. It is
        not speculation.
      </p>

      <p><strong>It is a symbol.</strong></p>

      <p>
        A digital revival of the Frang — the slang, the memory, the cultural
        heartbeat of Lebanese daily life.
      </p>

      <p><strong>A project at the intersection of:</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> heritage<br />
        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> technology<br />

        <span class="gold-bullet">•</span> emotional preservation
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, in the final room of the Museum, visitors understand that FRANGAIN
        is:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Coin Remembers — our heart.</strong><br />
        <strong>The Guardian of Memory — our shield.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        A tribute to what Lebanon was… and a promise of what it can still
        become.
