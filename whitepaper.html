      <h3>Introduction — A Token of Memory, Not Speculation</h3>
      <p>
        Frangain is not here to chase charts or make headlines. It is here to
        honor a fading piece of Lebanon’s cultural soul — the humble “frang.”
        Once held in every pocket, traded in markets, and tucked in drawers, the
        frang has disappeared from the economy but never from memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frangain brings it back — not as a currency to spend, but as a symbol to
        carry. On the blockchain, it is reborn not for speculation but for
        preservation. A digital tribute. A cultural reminder. A modern echo of a
        coin that meant far more than its value.
      </p>

      <!-- STORY OF THE FRANG -->

        <div class="container">
          <div class="section-title text-center">
            <h2>📜 The Story of the Frang</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              🕰️ <strong>Once upon a time in Lebanon</strong> — from the 1950s
              through the 1980s — the Lebanese pound (Lira) ruled daily life.
              Every coin, every note, every fraction mattered. Among them, one
              humble coin stood out: the smallest of them all, the
              <strong>5-piaster coin</strong>, lovingly and colloquially known
              as the <strong>Frang</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              🇫🇷 The name “Frang” was borrowed from the French Franc — a
              linguistic echo of Lebanon’s past under French influence. Over
              time, the Lebanese tongue transformed the foreign “Franc” into the
              more local and familiar “Frang.” It became more than a coin — it
              became part of the
              <em>language, the culture, and even the humor</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              💬 There was a common slang: <strong>“Frangain”</strong> —
              literally two Frangs — used to describe something extremely cheap
              or insignificant. “Your worth is Frangain,” people would say — not
              referring to someone’s wallet, but to their character.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite the nickname's sting, the Frang lived everywhere: in
              pockets, in jokes, in street markets, in songs.
              <strong>It had become folklore.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              ⏳ But like many small things in history, the Frang slowly
              vanished. Inflation erased its value. Time erased its memory. A
              coin once used by every Lebanese family was gone — forgotten by
              the young, remembered only in passing by the old.
            </p>

            <p>🔁 <strong>Until now.</strong></p>

            <p>
              💠 With the launch of <strong>Frangain (FRANG)</strong>, the Frang
              returns — not in metal, but in memory. A symbolic digital token
              that holds no monetary weight, but carries the full story of a
              forgotten past.
            </p>

            <p>
              It’s not meant to be rich. It’s meant to be
              <strong>real</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              💡 So the next time you hear “Frangain,” don’t think of something
              cheap. Think of something <strong>cultural</strong>. Something
              <strong>ours</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Think of a coin that once lived in every Lebanese hand — and now
              lives again on the blockchain.
            </p>

      <!-- SYMBOLIC DISTRIBUTION -->
      <h3>🎁 Symbolic Wallet Distribution</h3>

      <p>
        As part of its cultural mission, Frangain is shared symbolically through
        community gifting, cultural events, and personal encounters.
      </p>

      <p>
        These distributions are intentionally modest and symbolic in nature.
        They are designed to spread the story of the frang — not to incentivize
        speculation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This initiative does not alter total supply or tokenomics. It exists
        solely to carry memory into new hands.
      </p>

      <!-- SUPPORTERS -->
      <h3>🌟 Early Supporters & Cultural Contributors</h3>

      <p>
        During Frangain’s early journey, a small number of individuals offered
        sincere belief, encouragement, and support.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their role was not financial, promotional, or contractual — but human.
        Their presence strengthened the project’s cultural direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In recognition of this, symbolic allocations were granted to certain
        supporters as a gesture of appreciation and decentralization.

      <p>
        Frangain is not just a token. It is a memory made digital. A cultural
        echo minted in code. A tribute to what Lebanon once held — and still
        remembers.
      </p>

      <p>
        From dust to data. From story to symbol. From forgotten to forever.
        <strong>The Coin Remembers.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The Frang may have disappeared from Lebanon’s streets, but it never left
        its heart. With Frangain, this memory finds a new home — on the
        blockchain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frangain is not for everyone — but it was created for anyone who
        believes that some things are worth remembering.

    <!-- Naming Clarification -->
    <section class="disclaimer-section">
      <strong>Naming Clarification & Project Priority</strong><br />
      FRANGAIN is a cultural token rooted in Lebanese memory and digital
      heritage. It was officially deployed on the BNB Smart Chain on June 6,
      2025, under the contract address:<br />
      <code>0xBd8c479557CFF992f60c82e2f1B53969705509B1</code><br /><br />

      Recently, similar-sounding projects (e.g., FRAG, SANG) have appeared.
      These are entirely separate and unrelated.<br /><br />

      📌 FRANGAIN has no affiliation with Fragmetric, FRAG token, or any
      Solana-based protocol.<br /><br />

      The mission of Frangain is cultural preservation — not DeFi, staking, or
      yield services. It is a digital artifact meant to preserve meaning,
      folklore, and memory.

    <!-- Legal Disclaimer -->

      or France.<br /><br />

      It is a community-driven cultural project designed to honor heritage and
