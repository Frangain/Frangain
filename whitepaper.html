      <h3>Introduction — A Token of Memory, Not Speculation</h3>
      <p>
        Frangain is not here to chase charts or make headlines. It is here to
        honor a fading piece of Lebanon’s cultural soul — the humble “frang.”
        Once held in every pocket, traded in markets, and tucked in drawers, the
        frang has disappeared from the economy but never from memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frangain brings it back — not as a currency to spend, but as a symbol to
        carry. On the blockchain, it is reborn not for speculation but for
        preservation. A digital tribute. A cultural reminder. A modern echo of a
        coin that meant far more than its value.
      </p>

            <h2>📜 The Story of the Frang</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              🕰️ <strong>Once upon a time in Lebanon</strong> — from the 1950s
              through the 1980s — the Lebanese pound (Lira) ruled daily life.
              Every coin, every note, every fraction mattered. Among them, one
              humble coin stood out: the smallest of them all, the
              <strong>5-piaster coin</strong>, lovingly and colloquially known
              as the <strong>Frang</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              🇫🇷 The name “Frang” was borrowed from the French Franc — a
              linguistic echo of Lebanon’s past under French influence. Over
              time, the Lebanese tongue transformed the foreign “Franc” into the
              more local and familiar “Frang.” It became more than a coin — it
              became part of the
              <em>language, the culture, and even the humor</em>.
            </p>

            <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ddd" />

            <p>
              💬 There was a common slang: <strong>“Frangain”</strong> —
              literally two Frangs — used to describe something extremely cheap,
              insignificant, or even morally worthless. “Your worth is
              Frangain,” someone might say — not to insult someone’s wallet, but
              their character.
            </p>

            <p>
              And yet, despite the nickname's sting, it meant the Frang was
              everywhere: in pockets, in jokes, in street markets, in songs.
              <strong>It had become folklore.</strong>
            </p>

            <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ddd" />

            <p>
              ⏳ But like many small things in history, the Frang slowly
              vanished.<br />
              Inflation erased its value. Time erased its memory. A coin once
              used by every Lebanese family was gone — forgotten by the young,
              remembered only in passing by the old.
            </p>

            <p>🔁 <strong>Until now.</strong></p>

            <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ddd" />

            <p>
              💠 With the launch of <strong>Frangain (FRANG)</strong>, we bring
              the Frang back — not in metal, but in memory. A symbolic digital
              token that holds no monetary weight, but carries the full story of
              a forgotten past.
            </p>

            <p>
              It’s not meant to be rich. It’s meant to be <strong>real</strong>.
            </p>

            <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #ddd" />

            <p>
              💡 So the next time you hear “Frangain,” don’t think of something
              cheap.<br />
              Think of something <strong>cultural</strong>. Something
              <strong>ours</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Think of a coin that once lived in every Lebanese hand — and now
              lives again on the blockchain.
            </p>

      <h3>🎁 Symbolic Wallet Distribution</h3>
      <p>
        As part of Frangain’s cultural rollout, 100 wallets are being prepared
        for symbolic FRANG distribution. These wallets serve as digital relics —
        a tribute to Lebanese memory and the historical idea of “the Frang.”
      </p>
      <p>
        They will be shared during special moments or events, including the
        Frangain inauguration evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        This symbolic initiative does not affect the total supply or alter the
        official tokenomics. The first 20 wallets are already underway.
      </p>

      <h3>Use Case & Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Frangain is a cultural token — not a financial one.<br />
        Its purpose is not in yield farming or hype. It’s in remembrance, in
        storytelling, and in digital preservation. Future uses may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Roadmap</h3>

          (complete), token deployment on BSC (complete), token verification on
          BscScan, website and whitepaper launch
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Phase 2 — Trust Building:</strong> Liquidity pool creation on
          PancakeSwap, lock LP tokens and reserves on Unicrypt, open community
          channels (Telegram, Instagram, X), first community grants and
          supporter rewards
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Phase 3 — Cultural Activation:</strong> NFT collaborations for
          digital folklore preservation, launch educational content, initiate
          Pizza Grant (May 22), begin planning long-term Frang Fund
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Phase 4 — Perpetuation:</strong> Open community voting for
          future projects, partner with Lebanese creatives/NGOs, expand grants
          and rewards
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Honoring Laszlo Hanyecz</h3>
      <p>
        Frangain will always pay tribute to Laszlo Hanyecz, the man behind the
        first real-world crypto transaction — buying pizza for 10,000 BTC. As
        part of its mission to honor forgotten symbols and pioneers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>May 22 will be honored each year on all Frangain platforms.</li>
        <li>
          A symbolic Laszlo Pizza Grant will be awarded annually to unsung
          builders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Laszlo will be offered a personal symbolic grant of FRANG tokens.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        He reminds us that meaning in crypto is not just in value — but in
        vision.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-5">🧭 Final Words — More Than a Coin, A Story</h3>
      <p>
        Frangain is not just a token. It is a memory made digital. A cultural
        echo minted in code. A quiet tribute to what we once held and still
        remember.
      </p>

      <p>
        From dust to data. From story to symbol. From forgotten to forever.
        <strong>The Coin Remembers.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The Frang may have disappeared from the streets, but it never left the
        heart of Lebanon. With Frangain, we give this memory a new home — on the
        blockchain. This project is not about wealth or hype — it's about
        remembrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not for everyone — but it was made for anyone who believes some
        things are worth remembering.
      </p>

      <strong>Naming Clarification & Project Priority</strong><br />
      FRANGAIN is a symbolic token rooted in cultural identity and digital
      heritage. It was officially deployed on the BNB Smart Chain on June 7,
      2025, under the contract address:<br />
      <code>0xBd8c479557CFF992f60c82e2f1B53969705509B1</code><br /><br />
      Recently, other tokens with similar-sounding names such as FRAG and
      references to “SANG” have emerged in the crypto space. These projects are
      entirely separate and unrelated to FRANGAIN.<br /><br />
      📌 FRANGAIN has no affiliation with Fragmetric, FRAG token, or any
      Solana-based protocols.<br /><br />
      Our deployment date precedes their public listing on July 1, 2025, and our
      mission is wholly distinct. FRANGAIN is not a DeFi or restaking protocol —
      it is a cultural digital artifact designed to preserve meaning, memory,
      and folklore in the blockchain era.

      and is not affiliated with, any current or former government, currency, or
      institution in France, Lebanon, or elsewhere.<br />
      This project is a modern, community-driven initiative that draws
      inspiration from cultural and monetary history to promote accessibility,
      learning, and innovation in the blockchain space.
