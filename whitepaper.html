      <h3>Introduction — A Token of Memory, Not Speculation</h3>
      <p>
        Frangain is not here to chase charts or make headlines. It is here to
        honor a fading piece of Lebanon’s cultural soul — the humble “frang.”
        Once held in every pocket, traded in markets, and tucked in drawers, the
        frang has disappeared from the economy but never from memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frangain brings it back — not as a currency to spend, but as a symbol to
        carry. On the blockchain, it is reborn not for speculation but for
        preservation. A digital tribute. A cultural reminder. A modern echo of a
        coin that meant far more than its value.
      </p>

      <!-- STORY OF THE FRANG -->

        <div class="container">
          <div class="section-title text-center">
            <h2>📜 The Story of the Frang</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              🕰️ <strong>Once upon a time in Lebanon</strong> — from the 1950s
              through the 1980s — the Lebanese pound (Lira) ruled daily life.
              Every coin, every note, every fraction mattered. Among them, one
              humble coin stood out: the smallest of them all, the
              <strong>5-piaster coin</strong>, lovingly and colloquially known
              as the <strong>Frang</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              🇫🇷 The name “Frang” was borrowed from the French Franc — a
              linguistic echo of Lebanon’s past under French influence. Over
              time, the Lebanese tongue transformed the foreign “Franc” into the
              more local and familiar “Frang.” It became more than a coin — it
              became part of the
              <em>language, the culture, and even the humor</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              💬 There was a common slang: <strong>“Frangain”</strong> —
              literally two Frangs — used to describe something extremely cheap
              or insignificant. “Your worth is Frangain,” people would say — not
              referring to someone’s wallet, but to their character.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite the nickname's sting, the Frang lived everywhere: in
              pockets, in jokes, in street markets, in songs.
              <strong>It had become folklore.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              ⏳ But like many small things in history, the Frang slowly
              vanished. Inflation erased its value. Time erased its memory. A
              coin once used by every Lebanese family was gone — forgotten by
              the young, remembered only in passing by the old.
            </p>

            <p>🔁 <strong>Until now.</strong></p>

            <p>
              💠 With the launch of <strong>Frangain (FRANG)</strong>, the Frang
              returns — not in metal, but in memory. A symbolic digital token
              that holds no monetary weight, but carries the full story of a
              forgotten past.
            </p>

            <p>
              It’s not meant to be rich. It’s meant to be
              <strong>real</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              💡 So the next time you hear “Frangain,” don’t think of something
              cheap. Think of something <strong>cultural</strong>. Something
              <strong>ours</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Think of a coin that once lived in every Lebanese hand — and now
              lives again on the blockchain.
            </p>

      <!-- SYMBOLIC WALLET DISTRIBUTION -->
      <h3>🎁 Symbolic Wallet Distribution — 100 Cultural Gift Wallets</h3>

      <p>
        As part of Frangain’s cultural mission,
        <strong>100 symbolic gift wallets</strong> are being created and
        distributed. These wallets serve as digital relics — a tribute to
        Lebanese memory and to the historical idea of “the Frang.”
      </p>

      <p>
        These wallets are gifted during meaningful moments and cultural
        gatherings. This initiative does <strong>not</strong> affect tokenomics
        or total supply; it simply spreads the story of Frangain.
      </p>

      <h4>🔹 Phase 1 — 22 Gift Wallets (Completed / Underway)</h4>
      <p>
        A total of <strong>22 wallets</strong> were prepared in the first phase,
        each containing <strong>20,000 FRANG</strong>, and gifted during
        Christmas and early outreach.
      </p>

      <h4>🔹 Phase 2 — 38 Gift Wallets (Underway)</h4>
      <p>
        The next <strong>38 wallets</strong>, each with
        <strong>10,000 FRANG</strong>, are being prepared for new supporters.
      </p>

      <h4>🔹 Phase 3 — Remaining 40 Wallets (Upcoming)</h4>
      <p>
        The final <strong>40 wallets</strong> will be delivered over time
        through cultural events and community engagement.
      </p>

      <p>
        These symbolic distributions honor the old Frang, strengthen community
        engagement, and extend the cultural journey of Frangain.
      </p>

      <!-- SEVEN SUPPORTERS -->
      <h3>🌟 Seven Supporters Who Stepped In to Strengthen Frangain</h3>

      <p>
        Five months after the creation of Frangain, seven remarkable individuals
        stepped forward with sincere belief in the project's cultural purpose.
        Their encouragement, trust, and support helped guide Frangain through
        its early development.
      </p>

      <p>
        To honor their impact — and to decentralize the creator’s wallet — each
        supporter received a symbolic allocation of FRANG.
      </p>

      <p>
        These allocations do <strong>not</strong> affect liquidity or overall
        tokenomics; they recognize people who strengthened Frangain’s cultural
        mission.
      </p>

      <h4>🌿 Founding Supporter — 12,000,000 FRANG</h4>
      <p>
        A guiding figure during the earliest cultural direction of Frangain.
      </p>

      <h4>🌟 Heritage Steward — 10,000,000 FRANG</h4>
      <p>Dedicated to preserving the cultural essence behind the Frang.</p>

      <h4>🌱 Legacy Contributor — 10,000,000 FRANG</h4>
      <p>An early believer who supported the project’s foundational stages.</p>

      <h4>✨ The Four Early Believers</h4>
      <p>
        These four individuals expressed early belief in Frangain’s symbolic
        mission.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>⭐ Early Believer — <strong>5,000,000 FRANG</strong></li>

      <!-- FINAL WORDS -->
      <h3 class="mt-5">🧭 Final Words — More Than a Coin, A Story</h3>

      <p>
        Frangain is not just a token. It is a memory made digital. A cultural
        echo minted in code. A tribute to what Lebanon once held — and still
        remembers.
      </p>

      <p>
        From dust to data. From story to symbol. From forgotten to forever.
        <strong>The Coin Remembers.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The Frang may have disappeared from Lebanon’s streets, but it never left
        its heart. With Frangain, this memory finds a new home — on the
        blockchain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frangain is not for everyone — but it was created for anyone who
        believes that some things are worth remembering.

    <!-- Naming Clarification -->
    <section class="disclaimer-section">
      <strong>Naming Clarification & Project Priority</strong><br />
      FRANGAIN is a cultural token rooted in Lebanese memory and digital
      heritage. It was officially deployed on the BNB Smart Chain on June 6,
      2025, under the contract address:<br />
      <code>0xBd8c479557CFF992f60c82e2f1B53969705509B1</code><br /><br />

      Recently, similar-sounding projects (e.g., FRAG, SANG) have appeared.
      These are entirely separate and unrelated.<br /><br />

      📌 FRANGAIN has no affiliation with Fragmetric, FRAG token, or any
      Solana-based protocol.<br /><br />

      The mission of Frangain is cultural preservation — not DeFi, staking, or
      yield services. It is a digital artifact meant to preserve meaning,
      folklore, and memory.

      Frangain is inspired by the historical Lebanese nickname “Frang,” used
      widely in the 20th century for the French Franc coin. Frangain is not
      connected to any government, currency, or financial institution in Lebanon
      or France.<br /><br />

      It is a community-driven cultural project designed to honor heritage and
